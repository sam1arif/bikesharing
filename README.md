# NYC Citi Bikesharing analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
  
  In this analysis, we downloaded biksharing data from NYC Citi [Bikesharing website](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) for the month of August in 2019 to conduct an analysis on it using Tableau to see if it would make business sense to copy the same idea and apply it in the town of Des Moines.
